> This is a project focused on providing a better experience when playing RPG using Discord, for while, this project only has music features for the DM, but more features will come.

Currently, the project provides an interface that lets the DM control all the game music just by clicking buttons, instead of typing commands every time to do simple tasks, making it easier to improve the immersion in the game.
